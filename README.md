- ✅ **Rich Value Objects** (`Password`, `Address`)
- ✅ Separated layers: `application`, `adapters`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Java 25+**, Spring Boot 3.x
- JPA (in `adapters/persistence`)
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Gradle
- JUnit 5
- Jacoco

## 🔧 Running Locally
To run this application locally you have two options: 
- Without Docker
- With Docker

But first of all you have to:
- Clone the repository

### Without Docker
If you want to run without Docker you have to have:
- Java 25
- PostgreSQL running on port `5432`
- Kafka
And run on the root of the project this command: 

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
### With Docker 
But if you have docker:
First you run the infra with this command if you aren't already running the infra:
```bash
 docker compose -f docker-compose-infra.yml up -d 
```
After this run this command to run the app:
```bash
docker compose run -d
```
